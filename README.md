# Exploration: TenK template using Gatsby

Design goals for the frontend template used by tenkbay.com:

1. static assets on a server
2. internationalization
3. good SEO
4. automate-able ‚Äì most NFT projects will not want to edit the actual code; editing text and picking some colors should be enough
5. for projects which want more control, template should be straightforward to edit manually

This codebase explores using Gatsby, a static-site generator that uses React, to accomplish the above. It demonstrates accomplishing goals 1-4, but I think it fails at step 5:

- **Not straightforward to edit manually:** Gatsby seems super over-engineered. Rather than just parsing some JSON files with NodeJS, it pipes everything through a goofy and intimidating GraphQL system. Just to get access to files! Maybe with a good README and abstractions this would be forgivable, but it doesn't even seem to work that well. Just within the first day of working on this template, I noticed at least one big stumbling block: Gatsby's auto-reload kept breaking, and even doing manual browser refreshes often resulted in Gatsby telling me the page had errors, but all I had to do to fix these errors was restart the Gatsby server, which takes about ~1min every time. One minute is fine for first startup, but too long when it ends up being part of the core workflow.

# How this code works

1. Start by looking at [`settings.json`](./settings.json) and the JSON files in [the `i18n` folder](./i18n).
2. You'll see that these files are then used by [`gatsby-config.js`](./gatsby-config.js) and [`gatsby-node.js`](./gatsby-node.js).
3. `gatsby-node.js` uses [`src/templates/landing.tsx`](./src/templates/landing.tsx) to generate a separate page for each file in the `i18n` folder, which means in this case the site ends up with a `/en` page and a `/es` page.
4. [`src/pages/index.tsx`](./src/pages/index.tsx) is mostly empty, just showing a list of languages ("View in English", "Ver en Espa√±ol"), and automatically redirects to the user's preferred language if it's available.
5. [`src/components/layout.tsx`](./src/components/layout.tsx) makes use of the [`src/hooks/useLocales.ts`](./src/hooks/useLocales.ts) custom React hook to also show a language picker in the footer of the page.
6. You can really see how goofy it is to work with Gatsby by looking at the [`useLocales`](./src/hooks/useLocales.ts) hook. That GraphQL query? It's just grabbing all the files in the `i18n` folder.

# How automating such a site would work

When a project wants to launch a new TenK site, they would fill out a form that includes all necessary fields in `settings.json` (which could include color choices) and at least one locale file, such as `i18n/en.json`. There could also be optional fields (think: additional home page sections could be generated by including a `sections` array in `i18n/en.json`).

When they submit this form, we could make API calls to GitHub to clone this repo, edit the necessary JSON files, update `hero.png` and other assets, and deploy the website (either to GitHub Pages or some other static-site hosting service such as Netlify).

This repo could by default live in the github.com/tenkbay organization, but if the project wants to make manual edits they could for the repo and deploy it themselves.

  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
